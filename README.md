# Satellite 6 Perfomance Check

This is a personal project where I'm trying to learn how I can monitor and check the performance of the satellite based on evach componet Red Hat Satellite 6 is using. 

## How to run this script:

1. Download the python script to a system where you a sos-report from the satellite server.

2. Setup the system for the script to give beautiful results. 
~~~
$ sudo pip install PrettyTable
~~~

3. Run the script as root user.
~~~
# python perfcheck.py <sosreport-file>
~~~


# Limitation 

This script can only show content from the sos-report along with it does not include pasenger information as it is already depricated in the satellite 6.9.
